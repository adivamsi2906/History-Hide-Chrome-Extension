# History-Hide-Chrome-Extension

Client-Side Privacy- Enhancing and History Masking Chrome Extension Using Steganographic Techniques. 

🔐 Privacy-focused browsing aid: Designed a Chrome extension that replaces the browser’s history page with a static image or GIF, preventing unauthorized users from viewing private browsing history—especially useful in shared device scenarios.

🛡️ Cybersecurity relevance: Implements security through obfuscation, a foundational cybersecurity principle, by concealing sensitive history data behind irrelevant media—reducing risk of casual data exposure.

🧠 Cryptographic concept applied: Applies basic steganographic principles—a technique used in cybersecurity to hide information within other content—to visually mask browser history without removing it.

🚀 100% local, zero-data-leak solution: The extension performs all actions entirely client-side, with no external server calls or data transmission, ensuring zero risk of data leakage—a key privacy metric.

🛠 Built using front-end web technologies: Developed using HTML, CSS, and Chrome Manifest v3 APIs, demonstrating practical knowledge of browser architecture, permission handling, and UI-level content manipulation.

A lightweight privacy-enhancing Chrome extension with ties to basic cybersecurity concepts.

History Hider Chrome Extension We know that Chrome extensions make our tasks simpler and manage our chrome browser like blocking Ads,MP3 players,Video Players........that are very useful to be comfortable within the chrome browser without looking for an external application to do the task. Here we developed a small chrome extension that blocks showing history when we view history.Instead of displaying the history we display a dummy image,gif,any other irrelevant media.Thus we can attain privacy in case if we handle over our system to any other person. Here we used HTML,CSS and JSON files to display a gif instead of the history and we aligned the gif to be fit to the screen window perfectly.
